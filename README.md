# D3TECT implementation
This is the public repo of D3TECT. Papers results can be found in work/ as [Jupyter Notebook](work/D3TECT Paper Input.ipynb) and as an export of the [Jupyter Notebook HTML](work/D3TECT Paper Input.html).

If you want to re-compile the Jupyter Notebook's you need to download rabobank's threat-actor-data from the DeTTECT tool, which are used for the evaluation.
